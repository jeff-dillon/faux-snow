# faux-snow

After moving to Kentucky from Colorado I'm looking for some snowboarding options that don't involve a plane ride.This app will help find the best man-made powder conditions in the South and Midwest.
## Description

Good snow-making conditions require 2+ consecutive days of wet-bulb temperatures of 20(F) or below.

> If the temperature is around 30 F (-1 C), you need a fairly low relative humidity (less than 30 percent) for good snow-making conditions. If the temperature is less than 20 F (-6.7 C), you can make snow fairly easily even if the relative humidity is 100 percent. A temperature in the teens is ideal for snow-making.
